# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

--> Usually it was going good as the time I allocated for the practicals.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

--> It improved a lot. As the course progresses, my actual time for the practical reduced against the estimated time.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

--> I learnt the importance of time management and my consistency improved a lot that was lacking initially.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

--> I can progress on my code and I can fix the errors or improvement that I have to make.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

--> I learnt about the way of writing code of other people and enhance that particular thing in my other codes.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 8](https://github.com/Nafisatoushi/cp1404practicals/commit/cd29140e269f2936e38b444c43de42f2f45c0e9a#r149456879)

### Explanation

--> In this one, I went thorougly to all the files and pointed out the errors where necessary. Docstrings were major 
missings

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 6](https://github.com/yufei-leo/CP1404practicals/commit/b39d2744359e0539e34b54c1fb1d939e6b03fb5c)

### Explanation

--> This was the best I reviewed as I got some unnecessary files which I pointed out as review and pointed out the major
missing of docstring.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

--> The major two changes are:
 1. More real world projects.
2. Personalized feedback rather than the generic ones.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
--> The best part I did well was to be consistent and finish the practicals on time.
