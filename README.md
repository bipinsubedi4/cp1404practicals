## Clean Code Lessons Learned

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function and class should focus on one responsibility to keep the code
  organized and manageable.
- **Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Reusing code instead of duplicating it helps in minimizing errors and making updates
  easier.
- **Code Readability:** Writing clear, descriptive code and using proper indentation improves readability and
  collaboration.
